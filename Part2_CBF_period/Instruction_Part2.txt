Code 'parameter_CBF_period' is used to calculate the parameters of rise time in the rising period (from 20% to 80% of local peak amplitude), K-slope (slope of rising speed) in the rising period, and maximum and mean value in the plateau period.
Excel 'test' is the model data for CBF.
The result is shown in deal_data/Total data.xls
